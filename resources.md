### Analyzing the DOM

To analyze the DOM, you can use [DOM Inspector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6622/) add-on for Mozilla Firefox. You can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM_Inspector).

You can also use the [Web X-Ray Goggles](https://goggles.webmaker.org/) online tool which works on any browser and doesn't require any installations.

### Attribute Selectors

The various types of CSS Attribute Selectors are described well [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors).

All the CSS selectors are mentioned in the [Official CSS Selectors Specifications Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#selectors).

To view the different types of selectors, go [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Selectors).

### Pure-CSS Drop-down Menus

To view how you can create drop-down menus using pure CSS, read the last section in the [Selectors Tutorial Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Selectors).

### Text Styles

See [this blog post](http://kyleschaeffer.com/development/css-font-size-em-vs-px-vs-pt-vs/) to get an idea about the various units of sizes, and to see why I have selected the convention to follow that I have.

For full details of the properties that relate to fonts, see [Fonts](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html) in the CSS Specification. For full details of text decoration, see [Text](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html).
